# Brain Tumor MRI Classification Project

## Purpose of the Project

This project implements a deep learning solution for automatically classifying brain tumors from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. The system can distinguish between three different types of brain tumors and identify cases with no tumor present, which has significant applications in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Dataset Information

The project utilizes the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data) from Kaggle, created by Masoud Nickparvar. This comprehensive dataset provides a robust foundation for training and evaluating the classification model.

### Dataset Characteristics:

- **Total Images**: 7,023 MRI scans
- **Training Set**: 5,712 images
- **Testing Set**: 1,311 images
- **Image Format**: RGB images resized to 224×224 pixels
- **Data Source**: Kaggle dataset `masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset`

### Classification Categories:

The dataset includes four distinct classes representing different medical conditions:

1. **Glioma Tumor**: A type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells
2. **Meningioma Tumor**: Tumors that develop in the meninges (protective membranes covering the brain)
3. **Pituitary Tumor**: Growths that occur in the pituitary gland
4. **No Tumor**: Normal brain scans without any detectable tumors

This balanced representation allows the model to learn distinctive features for each category, enabling accurate differentiation between various tumor types and healthy brain tissue.

## Methods Used

### Deep Learning Architecture

The project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for medical image classification. The architecture follows modern best practices for computer vision tasks.

#### Model Architecture Details:

The network consists of three progressive convolutional blocks, each designed to extract increasingly complex features:

**Convolutional Block 1**: Processes raw image data to detect basic features like edges and textures

- Input channels: 3 (RGB), Output channels: 16
- Two 3×3 convolution layers with ReLU activation
- Batch normalization for training stability
- 2×2 max pooling for spatial dimension reduction

**Convolutional Block 2**: Combines basic features into more complex patterns

- Input channels: 16, Output channels: 32
- Similar structure to Block 1 with doubled channel capacity
- Enables detection of more sophisticated visual patterns

**Convolutional Block 3**: Extracts high-level semantic features specific to tumor characteristics

- Input channels: 32, Output channels: 64
- Captures complex spatial relationships crucial for medical diagnosis

**Classification Head**:

- Flattens feature maps into a single vector
- Applies dropout (20%) to prevent overfitting
- Linear layer maps features to four output classes

### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

To improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, the project employs comprehensive data augmentation techniques:

#### Training Data Augmentation:

- **Random Horizontal Flip**: Increases data diversity while maintaining medical validity
- **Random Rotation (±15°)**: Accounts for slight variations in MRI scan orientation
- **Random Resized Crop**: Simulates different zoom levels and positioning
- **Color Jitter**: Adjusts brightness, contrast, and saturation to handle scanner variations
- **Normalization**: Standardizes pixel values to [-1, 1] range for optimal training

#### Test Data Processing:

- Simple resize to 224×224 pixels
- Normalization matching training preprocessing
- No augmentation to ensure consistent evaluation

### Training Configuration

The model training employs modern optimization techniques for effective learning:

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay (0.0001) for regularization
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001 for stable convergence
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss appropriate for multi-class classification
- **Batch Size**: 128 images per batch for efficient GPU utilization
- **Training Duration**: 10 epochs with monitoring for convergence
- **Device**: GPU acceleration when available, with CPU fallback

### Monitoring and Visualization

The project incorporates comprehensive monitoring and interpretability tools:

#### TensorBoard Integration:

- Real-time tracking of training and validation losses
- Performance metrics visualization across epochs
- Model graph visualization for architecture understanding

#### Model Interpretability:

- **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**: Visualizes which regions of the MRI scan the model focuses on when making predictions
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides detailed breakdown of classification performance across all tumor types
- **Classification Report**: Presents precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class
